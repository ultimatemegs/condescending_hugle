## GeoNotes

Grid and raster can manipulate images  
bbox - this is like the extent for vectors
CRS - reference system
sp objects use S4 conventions w/ slots
sf objects are a df w/ specific str that incl. a geometry column
sf allows for mixed objects --> points + lines + polygons
Uses Well Known Text (WKT) & Well Known Binary (WKB) encoding 

## GeoTasks to get done this week: 
    # rejigging the extent
    # turning the raster into points and then pulling from sesync
    # email david about the original datasets 
    # check all the data for SBS for Tiela
    # do a
